					<td  colspan="3" align="center"  ><font color="red" ><b>Our Mission Statement</b></font>
<p id="top">Our Mission is to impart in the Students, Excellent Spiritual growth, excellent moral standard and excellent<br> academic performance which is geared towards building a total man. The school provides various platforms <br>for the spiritual development of the students and members of staff which are targeted at instilling love and fear of God,<br> discipline and enduring morals.</p>
<font color="red" ><b>The Set-Up of R.P.S.</b></font>
<p>The school has a Secondary School pattern, but Seminary in outlook. It is a Comprehensive School.<br> It is Co-Educational i.e. The School admits both Boys and Girls.<br> It is a FULL BOARDING SCHOOL. The Schools Academic Programme is of a 6-year duration, of 3 years<br> each at the JUNIOR SECONDARY STAGE and at the SENIOR SECONDARY STAGE.<br> Both are run on the same premises with separate Head Teachers, after the full disarticulation of the school<br> with a priest as the Apical head.</p>
<font color="red" ><b>Staffing</b></font>
<p>This institution is blessed with highly dedicated and well seasoned, experienced tutors and examiners<br> who are equally versatile administrators, bent on translating the VISION of the school to REALITY.<br> The introduction of the new UBE policy of 9-3-4 system of education has<br> afforded us opportunity to be closer to the students better than before.<br> The doggedly pursued compulsory to all students Junior School Basic Education Certificate Examination programme<br> in both State and National Examination Council has been crowned with wonderful success, and our WAEC, and NECO/O Level SSCE and Cambridge University<br> GCE International O & A Levels (track records of success)<br> will make the choice of our school come first to mind,<br> when parents are thinking about which school their children should attend.<br>

As you tread the same path with us all impossibility in your child will be settled by God in Jesus name.<br> We easily allow the past to rest while we remain focused towards a brighter future.<br> All we demand of you is your support each time we call on you to<br> partner with us on academic and social activities of the school,<br> which will further foster our relationship to the glory of God.</p>
<font color="red" ><b>Administration</b></font>
<p>The pioneering work of founding BMJS was tirelessly handled and managed by the Ven. J. Akin Odejide<br> (Retired Bishop) before he handed over the baton to the Young, dynamic,<br> energetic and experienced Revd. Olaoluwa Adeyemi (Now Venerable)<br> to carry on with the crusade of causing a positive change in the educational atmosphere of the nation,<br> Nigeria.<br>

The School is richly blessed with a good complement of a dedicated team of highly qualified top-flight Tutors,<br> with proven track-record of achievements and experience in similar institutions,<br> coupled with the Spirit-guided choice of a suitable principal,<br> Head Teachers and Assistant Head Teachers.<br>

There are also Heads of departments, efficient year Tutors, House managers and experienced Guidance Counsellors.<br> In the Non-academic sector are other support staff for the administrative department and Boarding House,<br> Kitchen and Laundry.</p>
<font color="red" ><b>History</b></font>
<p>
	The continuous need to improve the quality of Education at all levels of Education in Nigeria<br> has continued to engage the minds of all well meaning Nigerians.<br> This is because of the awareness of the significant contributions<br> which Education had made and can make to the five main objectives of Nigeria<br> as stated in the second National Development Plan and endorsed as the necessary foundation for the National Policy on Education.<br>

These are:

<ol width="50%">
	<li>A free and democratic society</li>
<li>A just and egalitarian society</li>
<li>A united, strong and self-reliant nation</li>
<li>A great and dynamic economy</li>
<li>A land of bright and full opportunities for all citizens</ol>
In consequence, the quality of Education at all levels has to be oriented towards inculcating the following values:<br>

<ol>
	<li>Respect for the worth and dignity of the individuals.</li>
<li>Faith in Mens ability to make rational decisions.</li>
<li>Moral and spiritual virtues in interpersonal and human relations</li>
<li>Shared responsibility for the common good of the society</li>
<li>Respect for the dignity of labour; and</li>
<li>Promotion of the emotional, physical and psychological health of all children.</li></ol>
It was in view of the above, that the National policy on Education was published in 1977,
 revised in 1981 and 2004.<br> In that Policy, there is also a provision for the encouragement of Private Organisations and individual to establish<br> Private Secondary School after fulfilling and strictly adhering to certain conditions.<br>

<p>Following the take-over of both Primary and Secondary Schools by the Government of the Federation,<br> both at Federal and State levels in 1976 especially by the Lagos State Government,<br> religious organisations were no more in control of their schools which they shad once established.<br>
The effect of this take-over of Schools was the fall in academic performance of students,<br> low moral standards and deteriorating physical infrastructural facilities in schools.<br> All efforts made by religious organisations for the government to return these schools to their original owners failed.<br></p>

However, today, government has now come to terms with our public schools are no longer<br> the haven of academic excellence combined with sound moral ethics,<br> that the old mission owned schools used to be known for and stand for<br>.

Government has therefore accepted in full, the need to allow, once again, private participation in Education,<br> through the establishment of private schools.<br>

It is in line with this new posture and policy that the Diocese of Lagos (Anglican Communion),<br> under the able leadership of the Bishop of Lagos and the Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion),<br> the Late Most Revd. Dr. Joseph Abiodun Adetiloye, D.O., at the 2nd Session of the 25th Synod of the Diocese of Lagos<br> held in May 1993 at All Saints Church, Yaba, resolved to establish a new Secondary School which will be a model and of the standard required of a Mission School. <br>It was however made clear that, unlike in the past, the diocese of Lagos would make the School a JUNIOR SEMINARY,<br> which will not only incorporate the present system of Secondary School as put in the National Policy on Education but also include<br> certain curricular of the Seminary/Theological institution.
